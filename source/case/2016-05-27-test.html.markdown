<p class="intro">
  Weiden+Kennedy 12â€™s ex Art-Director, Brad Holdgrafer, launched carefully curated online homewares store Formerly Yes, with his wife Jenna, in 2014.

  Six created a brand identity and online store for Formerly Yes that was intentionally minimal and unobtrusive, allowing the thoughtfully designed products to take centre stage. Shortly after launch, the website was recognised as being one of the top five online stores at the 2015 Webby Awards.

  Following the success of their online offering, the couple opened their first physical shop in downtown LA last year.
