      ### A 327 years old company wants a new website

      #### Husqvarna is one of the oldest companies in Sweden still in business. The company started as a gunsmith company appointed by the Swedish king in 1689 ( you can tell by the logotype as it symbolises the sight over the barrel ) and since then has been doing sewing machines, kitchen appliances, bicycles, motorbikes and now more recently outdoor equipment.

      During my time at DigitasLBi as a graphic designer Husqvarna approached us and wanted help to create the next generation global website for them. But before we were able to do that we had to win their hearts by pitching some ideas, designs and solutions that they would be happy to proceed with. We didn’t have many days to come up with a proposed design, however we did have many nights. We didn’t wait around for wireframes nor information architectures from our UX designers due to time constraints. This was a direct collaboration between marketeers, creative directors, copywriters and the designer, me.

      As the project kicked off I started focusing on improving the design from their current website at the time. I introduced a sensible typography hierarchy, reduced the usage of colours, the usage iconography, better font sizes for legibility, increasing whitespace for easier readability, and breathing space for the content. The very constant feedback loop from the rest of the creative team created an very agile design environment - enabling to visualise concepts and ideas very quickly. This was a classic case of hovering art-directors, except in this case everyone involved in the project was hovering. At the end of the pitch phase we had visualised a homepage with different states, a product detail page, a product listing page and a design style guide on how to use the new design.

      We won the client.

        ### Product details

        The product details page focuses on bringing out contextual stories with the product involved. The user can watch a promotional video of a forestry worker using the Husqvarna chain saw, read reviews, see related products and also at the end of the page there is a call to action to find a dealer.

        ###Retrospect

        That work that we done for Husqvarna wasn’t groundbreaking by any means in terms of UX nor design. We did what we could in the limited timeframe – however the fact the we won the client meant that our ideas and designs still resonated positively with Husqvarna. The pitch was a start of a bigger conversation between the client and us. Unfortunately I wasn’t around to help produce the final design and development which in itself would be another great challenge.

        The current live website is very similar to the pitchwork we did, which I believe is a mistake. The website in my mind needed more thoughtful UX decisions to be truly groundbreaking for the user. At the end of the day the new responsive website is still an improvement from the very corporate-esque website Husqvarna had previously. And I am still incredibly humbled to have had such impact on the design of the current website.
