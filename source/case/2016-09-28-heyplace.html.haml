        ### Geo-locked content.

        #### Unlock your friends photos or videos if you happen to be in that exact same spot where they took it.

        With the rise of ephemeral apps such as Snapchat. Me and a couple of friends
        decided to tackle another similar idea of but having geo-location dictating the content.

        ## Login

        The login logic was stripped down to be as simple as possible. We realised we could combine the most common user-scenarios into one screen.
        Simply enter your email. If the system doesn't find you you will have to register to continue. Else you'll be asked to enter your password. Et voilÃ .

      :code
        # lang: javascript
          if ( user.email = null ) {
            load.registerPage();
          } else {
            load.loginPage();
          }
          // 54% accurate code
    = partial(:'partials/grid-system/_image-full', :locals => {:image=> '/images/heyplace/login.png'})

        ## Home screens

        The user is presented with a overview of the latest photos or videos in their current area. The user may change to map view or nearby view to see which content is in their vincinity.

        ### A Hack

        The HeyPlace app was a result of a 12-hour Hackathon which took place in a dark old vault in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was beautiful.

        The app was planned weeks ahead the event so when the time came we had a pretty solid scaffold that we could work from. We had the servers set up and ready to send requests to and from our app, the HTML scaffold was build, even a basic design groundwork was put together. To put it short, we had a MVP version working before the event even started. But we still had to put the pieces together in mere 12 hours.

        ## Account + Comments

        Because you can't see other peoples content unless you are in the geo-tagged area. We had to display a map instead of an array of photos/videos.
    = partial(:'partials/grid-system/_image-full', :locals => {:image=> '/images/heyplace/account.png'})

        ## Camera

        The user may swipe through from a selection of filters to enchance the images that they took.
        Nothing fancy.

        ### Hackathon success ðŸŒŸ

        After some positive reviews from the jury of the Hackathon we decided quickly that we wanted to proceed with the idea and create something beyond a prototype. Also the idea of having created your own iPhone application was very exciting and a good exercise we started having secret meetings after work to continue developing the application.

        ## Iconography

        The iconography was designed to be elegant and simple. But we took it a step further.
        To inject some emotion into the iconography we went the anthropomorphic (I just want to use that word) route
        and added a friendly face to the heart icon. The icon could work nicely as a mascot
        for the brand in the future.

        ### Closing thoughts

        We never anticipated how hard it is to create a social app that actually works.
        The learnings on how to design a real iOS application was very valuable. It's very different from
        web-responsive design.

        The app itself obviously didn't gain any traction because the lack funds for marketing.
        Regardless it feels good to have an app in the App Store.

        The design that you are seeing is a visual update of the current app. Functionality intact.
