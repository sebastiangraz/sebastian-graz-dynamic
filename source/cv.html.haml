          #### Profile

          Designer and developer with 5 years of experience. My main jam is rapid
          prototyping, iterative design and branding. I have been involved in
          challenging projects ranging from small projects to extensive 100-page
          e-commerce projects. I dabble in animated videos, 3D imagery and
          audio production. I longboard everywhere.

          #### This Place — 2014-2016

          Hired as a Senior User Experience Designer I was responsible for the UX
          and UI for projects which included massive E-Commerce replatforming,
          website redesigns and branding in close collaboration with the clients
          and the end-users.

          I was involved in conducting qualitative user testing sessions in which
          the results were documented and collaborated with the client. The
          user testing was based on the rapid prototyping projects that I helped
          develop

          I was also involved in production ready front-end development for a
          major website redesign, this included: CSS-architechture, markup
          structure and Javascript interactions.

          Volvo Penta, Husqvarna, Tena, Ascom, Majblomman and JKL
