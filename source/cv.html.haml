          #### This Place — 2014-2016

          Hired as a senior user experience designer I was responsible for the UX
          and UI for projects which included massive E-Commerce re-platforming,
          website redesigns and branding in close collaboration with the client
          and the end-users.

          I was involved in conducting qualitative user testing sessions in which
          the results were documented and presented to the client. The
          user testing was based on the rapid prototyping projects that I helped
          develop.

          I was also involved in production ready front-end development for
          major website redesigns, this included: CSS-architecture, markup
          structure and Javascript interactions.

          #### DigitasLBi — 2011-2014

          I joined DigitasLBi Sweden as an intern, but later became a full-time
          visual designer.
          I designed the UI for clients such as: Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks,
          Volvo Penta, Husqvarna, Tena, Ascom, Majblomman and JKL.

          During my time at DigitasLBi I had the opportunity to part of the
          pitch team to lead the design direction and execution for Volvo Cars,
          Volvo Trucks and Husqvarna. Winning Husqvarna lead to producing their
          global website and many other products in the future.
