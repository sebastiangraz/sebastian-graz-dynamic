          Designer and developer with 5 years of experience. My main jam is rapid
          prototyping, iterative design methodology and branding. I have experience
          in designing extensive e-commerce projects as well as aesthetic campaign websites.
          I also dabble in animated videos, 3D imagery and audio production.

          #### This Place, London <br/>2014-2016

          *User experience designer*, responsible for the UX
          and UI for projects which included massive E-Commerce re-platforming,
          website redesigns and branding in close collaboration with the client
          and the end-users.

          Involved in conducting qualitative *user testing* sessions in which
          the results were documented and presented to the client. The
          user testing was based on the *rapid prototyping* projects that I helped
          develop.

          *Front-end development* for
          major website redesigns, this included: *CSS-architecture, markup
          structure and Javascript interactions*.
