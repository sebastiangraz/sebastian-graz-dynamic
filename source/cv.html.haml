          #### This Place

          Hired as a Senior User Experience Designer I was responsible for the UX
          and UI for various projects which included massive E-Commerce replatforming, website
          redesigns and branding in close collaboration with the clients and the end-users.

          At This Place I was involved in conducting qualitative user testing sessions in which
          the test results were documented and collaborated with the client. The user testing was
          based on the rapid prototyping projects that I helped develop

          I was also involved in production ready front-end development for a major website redesign,
          this included: CSS-architechture, markup structure and javascript interactions.
