#### A simple disclosure of technologies

When I started re-designing my portfolio I knew from the start that it would be
defined by the tech stack I would choose. Had I chosen something more conventional
like Wordpress or Drupal that would mean I would be constrained to their conventions
in terms of code and layout. That didn't fly well with me

For this portfolio I used [Middleman][df29b96c] because I was comfortable using it
since previous rapid prototyping projects. With Middleman each page loads instantly
and that sat well with me.

Because Middleman is based on Rails I had the power to do some complex looping to
keep my code as [DRY][f7eacd16] as possible
