### My 15-minutes-of-fame happened back in 2014 I started designing a typeface for the cryptocurrency ''Dogecoin''.

#### The font named Doge Sans' was picked up by several design articles and met with negative criticism, comparing my work to [Tommy Viseau][a659234c] — Which in retrospect is quite flattering, but maybe not so much back then. And in this article I will share some thoughts how to deal with mass criticism of both kinds.



### To give some examples of some criticism I received.

> "Doge Sans" Is Even Worse Than Comic Sans.

<!-- test -->


> It may be too soon to write the font off completely,
> but in its current state, we don't see a drastic improvement.


<!-- test -->


> Other than simply being an alternative, why is Doge Sans better than Comic Sans?
> There seem to be a lot of comments here that praise this
> typeface only because Comic Sans is so reviled ...

<!-- test -->

> Doge Sans feels like it’s trying too hard to be gaudy.

<!-- test -->

> If we’re going to make a new font in the name of Comic Sans being horrible,
> let’s at least make one that’s more legible.

So far it's not looking good for my self-esteem.

### Know that controversial matters will always be subjective

In my case changing the font from Comic Sans to my proposed Doge Sans was not well received because it directly challenged what the Dogecoin community is accustomed too.

Most people will not like change by default and simply by understanding this, we know that drastic changes will almost always be met with controversy. This can be seen throughout many re-design rollouts. Remember Instagram logo redesign? Airbnb? London 2012 Olympic logo?

### Negative criticism is still valuable criticism

The good thing about delicate topics is that it will attract a lot of opinions and critics will pour their heart out to explain why you are wrong or right. This is an excellent opportunity to carefully decode the message hopefully without having to weed through too many swear words.

Negative feedback, especially from anonymous internet users can be very powerful because it most of the time the feedback is very no-holds-barred honest. The anonymous user have no reason to white lie their opinion. As opposed to asking a friend for feedback will often result in quite positively-biased feedback.

### The common person won't really care
It is important to note that blog writers or editors are meant to encourage discussion and will often write their articles in a way that makes a topic appear controversial even though it's not really.

Why? Because this is usually how they attract traffic. A study conducted by [Outbrain][c98b2c6d] claims that negative headlines receive 69% higher averaged click-through rates, and these smart writers know that. Why is that percentage so high? Because readers perceive negative superlatives to be more authentic and impartial as opposed to feel-good, cliche headlines.

### If you learn from it, you're doing it right

Design as a discipline is an ever-learning career. I don't think I need to mention that failure begets success. Thats how we learn. In my case I wanted to learn how to design a typeface and release it into the wild without really thinking about its success. Regardless of all resistive comments, critique or feedback I still learned how to design a font and that's really the only thing that matters.


### Conclusion

My font Doge Sans was an attempt to change something. People didn't like it, some people did. The world spins on.

One may feel discouraged after spending many hours on a completed design only to be faced with negative critique. It might be of comfort to know that we may never please every user we design from a visual perspective. whether it's a new typeface, website or identity.
